            <h2> About Us</h2>
            <p> Welcome! We’re Stage Fright, an up and coming band from Okmulgee, a small town in Oklahoma. We’re just a group of friends who have a passion for music, and decided to put our talents towards something. Which it must have worked if you’re here right now! We’ve been making music for a few years now, and we’re shocked, and amazed at all the support we have gotten on our music. We plan to keep making music for the foreseeable future, and are on tour NOW! Come see us at one of our locations near you!

                    <h3> Annette Lorraine
</h3>
                    <p> Annette is the lead singer: She and Lydia met during a homeschool theater class a decade ago. She graduated college with a degree in dance, which comes in handy when she's dazzling on stage. She met Asher through a ragtag theater group that her and Lydia were a part of. The weekends acting together fostered a strong bond between the three that can be seen on stage with how they interact. She had a knack for writing ever since she was young, that greatly benefited the band as she wrote most of the songs. </p>

                    <h3> Gabby Miller
 </h3>
                    <p> Gabby is the lead guitarist: She’d only known the other members a few months before jumping at Lydia’s idea of a rock band. She had become friends with Asher and Lydia through a class together, but her first time meeting Annette was at their first band practice. It’s lucky they hit it off so fast, because the team’s bond greatly added to their chemistry on stage. While she may be quiet at times, she carries the entire band with her chaotic moves on stage and fun personality. Fans are often surprised by her personality at meetups because it’s so different from what she presents on stage.

                    <h3> Asher Null
 </h3>
                    <p> Asher is the bass player: He became best friends with Lydia after years of acting together in stage plays. Asher was actually the brains behind the band’s name, after jokingly stating he had stage fright. They got really comfortable with each other through the plays they acted in and feel more like siblings than bandmates. The two would spend nights staying up until 4am together singing karaoke, eating pizza rolls, and talking nonsense together. Eventually those sleepless nights developed into brainstorming sessions where they would spend hours coming up with new song names, most of which didn't make the cut.

                    <h3> Lydia Jackson
 </h3>
                    <p> Lydia is the drummer: She met the other band members through her years at Green Country Technology Center in a programming class, as well as her years in acting. She had always been very technically minded, with dreams to become a recording engineer. Which played in the band’s favor, as Lydia took it upon herself to record and produce their first two albums herself. She was classically trained as a pianist in her younger years of homeschool, but abandoned that to teach herself how to play the drums, having always admired Dusk from the Hex Girls. She was also the brains behind the band’s creation, suggesting the idea of one of those sleepless nights out of boredom. Being the biggest extrovert in the group she was able to bring everyone together, and keep everyone on task.  </p>
